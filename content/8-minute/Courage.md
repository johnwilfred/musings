Seeing the right perspective requires loads of courage. Courage has to be practised. It does not bloom. It often accompanies necessity. But when it gushes out of necessity it is very short lived and not logical, this is purely because of our thrive to survive. Courage with no logical can be brutal. Courage accompanied by logical thinking slows you down. When you have a slower pace, then courage is never brutal. A brutal force always creates havoc. So does courage with no logical thinking. Isn't thinking always logical?A prejudiced thinking is never logical. It really is biased with its own folly. The best part is you never realise the folly but you go along with it. You take the jolly ride. There will be no closure to this side. The jolly ride leads to a brutal courage which lacks logical thinking and a perspective outlook. It is a vicious cycle and the cycle continues.
